# CharCreation

Automating D&D 5.0 character creation. 

This is not intended for characters over level 20. 

This only supports the standard Player's Handbook. 

WIP: Adding in additional support and cleaning up excess code. Main.go.bak and diceroll are functional, but the remaining are in development and untested.
